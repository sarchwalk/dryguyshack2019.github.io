	<h2>
		Benefits
	</h2>
	<p>
		Shoveling requires a lot of energy and time to do, or expensive machinery. <br>
		The landscaping roomba requires no supervision. <br>
		It won't require large outputs of energy as it will be able to work semi-continuously. <br>
		No toxic fumes as it uses an electric motor.  <br>
		It will also be rather inexpensive, and quiet compared to snowblowers. <br>
	</p>
	<h2>
		How?
	</h2>
	<img src="https://github.com/sarchwalk/dryguyshack2019Code/blob/master/thumbnail_image3.jpg?raw=true" alt="Salt Sprinkler" style="float:right;width:500px;height:400px;">

	<p>
		Continuous work prevents snow accumulation and ice formation. <br>
		Docking stations will charge the roomba, and refill the salt. <br>
		Employing a data scraper will allow the roomba to only work when it snows based on up-to-date information. <br>
		Larger wheels make the roomba be able to traverse more difficult terrain. <br>
	</p>
	<h2>
		Marketability
	</h2>
	<p>
		Ideal for universities, parks, homes, and other areas that have walkways that need to be cleared of snow.<br>
		Can help push cities, like Calgary, as bike-friendly by clearing bike-paths. <br>
	</p>

	<h2>
		Security
	</h2>
	<p>
		Docking station and roombas will have IDs that will need to be verified to work. <br>
		Integrated GPS allows easy tracking of roombas if they get misplaced. <br>
		Visible paint and flag will reduce accidents involving the roombas. <br>
