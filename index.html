					Continuous work prevents snow accumulation and ice formation. <br>
					Docking stations will charge the roomba, and refill the salt. <br>
					Employing a data scraper will allow the roomba to only work when it snows based on up-to-date information. <br>
					Larger wheels make the roomba be able to traverse more difficult terrain. <br>
