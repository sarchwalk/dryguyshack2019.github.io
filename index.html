	<h5>
		The landscaping roomba is a modified roomba that takes in weather data.<br>
		It shovels and salts the ground.<br>
		It launches whenever snow is falling.<br>
	</h5>
	<h2>
		Benefits
	</h2>
	<p>
		Shoveling requires a lot of energy and time to do, or expensive machinery. <br>
		The landscaping roomba requires no supervision. <br>
		It won't require large outputs of energy as it will be able to work semi-continuously. <br>
		No toxic fumes as it uses an electric motor.  <br>
		It will also be rather inexpensive, and quiet compares to snowblowers. <br>
	</p>
	<h2>
		How?
	</h2>
	<p>
		Continuous work prevents snow accumulation and ice formation. <br>
		Docking stations will charge the roomba, and refill the salt. <br>
		Employing a data scraper will allow the roomba to only work when it snows based on up-to-date information. <br>
	</p>
	<h2>
		Marketability
	</h2>
	<p>
		Ideal for universities, parks, and other areas that have walkways that need to be cleared of snow.<br>
		Can help push cities, like Calgary, as bike-friendly by clearing bike-paths. <br>
	</p>
	<h2>
		Security
	</h2>
	<p>
		Docking station and roombas will have IDs that will need to be verified to work. <br>
